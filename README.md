RubyFlux: a Ruby to Java compiler
----------------------------------

RubyFlux is a compiler that turns a Ruby codebase into a closed set of .java
source files suitable for running on any JVM with no additional runtime
requirement.

A .java file is produced for the toplevel of each file and for each Ruby class
declaration encountered. Methods are emitted as normal Java methods, but with
an abstract implementation on RObject so all dynamic calls can simply be
Java virtual calls. The rest of Ruby syntax maps to mostly what you'd expect
in Java code.

Usage
=====

Here's an example session for using RubyFlux today:

```
# First need to build the compiler's jar
$ mvn package

# Provide the target and src dirs to -I flag along with -e or a group of files
# to compile
$ jruby -I target:src/main/ruby src/main/ruby/ruby_flux.rb -e "def fib(a); a < 2 ? a : fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2); end; puts fib(40)"

# The Ruby sources are translated to .java and all support code is copied out
# of RubyFlux for the compilation step.
#
# A -e argument will produce a DashE.java file. A list of sources will produce
# a .java file for each.
$ javac DashE.java

# All files are now compiled and in cwd, and DashE can be run directly
$ java DashE

The resulting .class files can be packaged alone, with no runtime dependencies.
